# Introduction
A mutator utilizing Mian's Custom Flags Framework which allows you to replace Eagle/Raven flags with pride flags featuring multiple sexualities and identities!

This mutator is purely for entertainment (and is also just a template for my framework if im being honest). I do not mean for this to reflect any pride/political related things happening in real life. In the end you are just fighting blocky people :0

This adds about 50+ pride related flags to the framework.

There should also be no significant performance drain with this mutator compared to other flag mutators. If you find that there is a significant change in performance, let me know in the issue tracker for the framework.

More information about the framework this mutator is dependent on can be found [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3385310995).

# Credits and Template

The original framework was created by Red and then was initially altered by me to help with performance. If you want to create your own flag mutators with my framework, find a tutorial [here](https://github.com/MianReplicate/Mian-Custom-Flags-Framework).
